This is a clone of the repository used to produce the released version of the application with the exception of obfuscating encryption and analytics keys. The project relies heavily on Tau - middleware developed by me that is not in public domain yet. The functionality of Tau includes providing platform abstraction, language constructs, basic development components and build system support. This also means a number of auto generated files needed to produce the application binaries are not part of this repository. It's public solely for inspection and review purposes.
